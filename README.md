optimize
========

This library provides some functions to make optimization in python easier.
It can use `scipy.optimize` and `ipopt` as minimizers. Also, it provides
an interface that makes minimizing functions of multiple variables easier,
especially if only a subset of the variables should be considered for the
optimization.
